# YuanshenServer

Just something I did in my free time. Nothing serious. Maybe i'll update it *some* day.  
Most of the credit goes to RustySamovar.

Requires json & protos in the `assets/json` & `assets/protos` folders.

Can be deployed with docker-compose.

The main objective was to play around with Typescript, Monorepos and Docker. Making a private server for a certain anime game was secondary.

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).
